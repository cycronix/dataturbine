     Modified:
         EMF 12/08/2005: added Java1.4 Tomcat compatibility file
         JPW 08/20/2007: Third_Party directory has been moved out of the
	                 Source directory (it now resides at the top level
			 alongside Source).  Therefore, in this build file,
			 I had to change how to find definitions.xml.
         WHF 2009/04/29: Removed file copy of archives.  Unzip tomcat.
		 
     Description:
         This file is the primary Ant build file for the third party
         applications.
