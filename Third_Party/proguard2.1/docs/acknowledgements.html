<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<b>ProGuard</b> grew out of <b>RetroGuard</b>, which its author Mark Welsh has
kindly made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<b>RetroGuard</b> is a very nice piece of code, but it only performs
obfuscation. I started from the class file parsing code and wrote my own
shrinker and obfuscator. At this point, both programs have little code in
common.
<p>

<a href="mailto:dirk.schnelle@web.de">Dirk Schnelle</a> has generously
contributed the Ant task. He is also maintaining it, offering help for any
questions related to the integration with Ant.
<p>

I am developing ProGuard in my spare time, in part on equipment that my
employer <a href="http://www.luciad.com/" target="other">Luciad</a> is kindly
allowing me to use.
<p>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/projects/proguard/"
target="other">SourceForge</a> is graciously providing the resources for
hosting this project and many other projects.
<p>

My colleagues at Luciad have been very patient trying early versions of the
code. Since the first public release, others have chimed in with interesting
ideas, bug reports, and bug fixes: Thorsten Heit, Oliver Retzl, Jonathan
Knudsen, Bob Drury, Dave Jarvis, Marc Chapman, Dave Morehouse, Richard
Osbaldeston, Peter Hawkins, Mark Sherington, David Sitsky, and James Manning.
Thanks! Your feedback has been invaluable.
<p>

The code and these web pages were written using Sun's JDKs, IBM Eclipse,
GNU emacs, bash, sed, awk, and a whole host of other free tools which continue
to make programming interesting.
