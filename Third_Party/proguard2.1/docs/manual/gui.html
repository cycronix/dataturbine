<h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>

To run the ProGuard graphical user interface, just type:
<p class="code">
<code><b>java -jar proguardgui.jar</b> [-nosplash] </code>[<i>configuration_file</i>]
</p>
The GUI will pop up in a window. With the <code>-nosplash</code> option, you
can switch off the short opening animation. If you have specified a ProGuard
configuration file, it will be loaded. The GUI works like a wizard. You can
edit the configuration and execute ProGuard through a few tabs:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#proguard">ProGuard</a></td>
    <td>Load an existing configuration file.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#input">Input</a></td>
    <td>Specify the input jars, resource jars, and library jars.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#keep">Keep</a></td>
    <td>Specify what ProGuard should keep.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#output">Output</a></td>
    <td>Specify the output jars and any special options.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#process">Process</a></td>
    <td>View and save the resulting configuration, and run ProGuard.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

In addition, there is a tab to execute ReTrace interactively:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button"><a href="#retrace">ReTrace</a></td>
    <td>Set up and run ReTrace, to de-obfuscate stack traces.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

You can freely toggle between the tabs by means of the buttons on the left-hand
side of the window, or by means of the <b>Previous</b> and <b>Next</b> buttons
at the bottom of the tabs.
<p>

<a name="proguard">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The ProGuard Tab</h2>

The <i>ProGuard</i> tab presents a welcome message and one important button at
the bottom:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button">Load configuration...</td>
    <td>opens a file chooser to load an existing ProGuard configuration
    file.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

If you don't want to load an existing configuration, you can just continue
creating a new configuration from scratch.
<p>

<a name="input">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The Input Tab</h2>

The <i>Input</i> tab has three lists, respectively to specify the input jars
(or directories), the resource jars (or directories), and the library jars (or
directories):

<ul>
<li>The input jars contain the class files to be processed.
<li>The resource jars contain additional resource files to be copied to the
    output jars.
<li>The library jars are not copied to the output jars; they contain class
    files that are extended by class files in the input jars and that are
    necessary for correct processing. It typically at least contains the
    targeted Java runtime jar.
</ul>
<p>

Each of these lists can be edited by means of a couple of buttons on the
right-hand side:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button">Add...</td>
    <td>opens a file chooser to add a jar or directory to the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Edit...</td>
    <td>opens a file chooser to edit the selected entry in the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Filter...</td>
    <td>opens a text entry field to add or edit the filter of the selected
    entries in the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Remove</td>
    <td>removes the selected entries from the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move up</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries one position up the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move down</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries one position down the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move to libraries</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries in the list of program jars to the list of
    library jars.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Copy to resources</td>
    <td>copies the selected entries in the list of program jars to the list of
    resource jars.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move to program</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries in the list of library jars to the list of
    program jars.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Filters allow to filter the files from the specified jars or directories,
based on the file names.
<p>

The order of the jars and directories in each list may matter, as the first
occurrence of any duplicate entries gets precedence, just as in conventional
class paths.
<p>

Corresponding configuration options:
<ul type="none">
<li>-<a href="usage.html#injars">injars</a>
<li>-<a href="usage.html#resourcejars">resourcejars</a>
<li>-<a href="usage.html#libraryjars">libraryjars</a>
<li><a href="usage.html#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="keep">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The Keep Tab</h2>

The <i>Keep</i> tab has a fixed list and a variable list of classes and class
members (fields and methods) that must be protected from shrinking and/or from
obfuscation.
<p>

The fixed list contains predefined entries that are typically useful for many
applications. Each of these entries can be toggled by means of a check box.
The text field following each entry allows to constrain the applicable classes.
by means of a comma-separated list of wildcarded, fully-qualified class
names. The default is "*", which means that all input classes of the
corresponding type are considered.
<p>

For example, checking the <b>Applications</b> entry and filling in
"myapplications.**" after it would mean: keep all classes that have a main
method in the "myapplications" package and any of its subpackages.
<p>

The <b>Special</b> list at the bottom allows to define additional entries
yourself. The list can be edited by means of a couple of buttons on the
right-hand side:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button">Add...</td>
    <td>opens a window to add a new entry to the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Edit...</td>
    <td>opens a window to edit the selected entry in the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Remove</td>
    <td>removes the selected entries from the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move up</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries one position up the list.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Move down</td>
    <td>moves the selected entries one position down the list.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

The interface windows allow to specify classes, fields, and methods. They
contain text fields and check boxes to constrain these items. They have
<b>Ok</b> and <b>Cancel</b> buttons to apply or to cancel the operation.
<p>

For example, your application may be creating some classes dynamically using
<code>Class.forName</code>. You should then specify them here, so they are kept
by their original names. Press the <b>Add...</b> button to open the class
window. Fill out the fully-qualified class name in the <b>Code</b> text field,
and press the <b>Ok</b> button. Repeat this for all required classes. Wildcards
can be helpful to specify a large number of related classes in one go. If you
want to specify all implementations of a certain interface, fill out the
fully qualified interface name in the <b>Extends/implements class</b> instead.
<p>

For more advanced settings, it is advisable to become familiar with ProGuard's
configuration options through the <a href="usage.html">Usage section</a> and
the <a href="examples.html">Examples section</a>.  We'll suffice with a brief
overview of the three dialogs provided by the GUI.
<p>

The <i>keep class</i> dialog appears when adding or editing new special keep
entries. It has text fields and selections for specifying and constraining
classes and class members to keep.

<ul>
<li>The <b>Comments</b> text field allows to add optional comments to this
    entry. The comments will identify the entry in the list and they will
    appear as comments in the configuration file.

<li>The first <b>Keep</b> selection allows to specify whether you want to
    protect the specified classes and class members from being shrunk and from
    being obfuscated, or just from being obfuscated.

<li>The second <b>Keep</b> selection allows to specify whether you want to
    protect the specified classes and their specified class members, or just
    the specified class members from the specified classes, or the specified
    classes and the specified class members, if the class members are present.
    Note that class members will only be protected if they are explicitly
    specified, even if only by means of a wildcard.

<li>The <b>Access</b> selections allows to specify constraints on the class or
    classes, based on their access modifiers.

<li>The <b>Class</b> text field takes the fully-qualified name of the class or
    classes. The class name can contain wildcards.

<li>The <b>Extends/implements class</b> text field takes the fully-qualified
    name of the class or interface that the above classes must extend.

<li>The <b>Class members</b> list allows to specify a list of fields and
    methods to keep. It can be edited by means of a list of buttons on the
    right-hand side.
</ul>
<p>

The <i>keep field</i> dialog appears when adding or editing fields within the
above dialog. It has text fields and selections for specifying and constraining
fields to keep.

<ul>
<li>The <b>Access</b> selections allows to specify constraints on the field or
    fields, based on their access modifiers.

<li>The <b>Return type</b> text field takes the fully-qualified type of the
    field or fields. The type can contain wild-cards if it is a class name.

<li>The <b>Name</b> text field takes the name of the field or fields. The field
    name can contain wildcards.
</ul>
<p>

Similarly, the <i>keep method</i> dialog appears when adding or editing methods
within the keep class dialog. It has text fields and selections for specifying
and constraining methods to keep.

<ul>
<li>The <b>Access</b> selections allows to specify constraints on the method or
    methods, based on their access modifiers.

<li>The <b>Return type</b> text field takes the fully-qualified type of the         method or methods. The type can contain wild-cards if it is a class name.

<li>The <b>Name</b> text field takes the name of the method or methods. The
    method name can contain wildcards.

<li>The <b>Arguments</b> text field takes the comma-separated list of
    fully-qualified method arguments. Each of these arguments can contain
    wildcards, if it is a class name.
</ul>
<p>

Corresponding configuration options:
<ul type="none">
<li>-<a href="usage.html#keep">keep</a>
<li>-<a href="usage.html#keepclassmembers">keepclassmembers</a>
<li>-<a href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembers">keepclasseswithmembers</a>

<li>-<a href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembernames">keepclasseswithmembernames</a>
<li><a href="usage.html#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="output">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The Output Tab</h2>

The <i>Output</i> tab has a list the specify the output jars or directories,
and a couple of panels with various settings.
<p>

The list of output jars can be edited by means of a couple of buttons on the
right-hand side, identical to those on the <a href="#keep">Keep tab</a>.
Filters allow to filter the output files, based on their names. Multiple
entries in this list only make sense when combined with filters; each output
file is written to the first entry with a matching filter.
<p>

Corresponding configuration options:
<ul type="none">
<li>-<a href="usage.html#outjars">outjars</a>
<li><a href="usage.html#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a>
<li>-<a href="usage.html#keepattributes">keepattributes</a>

<li>-<a href="usage.html#dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses">dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses</a>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="process">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The Process Tab</h2>

The <i>Process</i> tab has an output console for displaying the configuration
and the messages while processing. There are three important buttons at the
bottom:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button">View configuration</td>
    <td>displays the current ProGuard configuration in the console.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Save configuration...</td>
    <td>opens a file chooser to save the current ProGuard
    configuration.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">Process!</td>
    <td>executes ProGuard with the current configuration.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

<a name="retrace">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>The ReTrace Tab</h2>

The <i>ReTrace</i> tab has a panel with a few settings, an input text area for
the obfuscated stack trace, and an output console to view the de-obfuscated
stack trace:

<ul>
<li>The <b>Verbose</b> check box in the settings panel allows to toggle between
    normal mode and verbose mode.

<li>The <b>Mapping file</b> text field takes the name of the mapping file that
    ProGuard wrote while processing the original code. The file name can be
    entered manually or by means of the <b>Browse...</b> button that opens a
    file chooser.

<li>The <b>Obfuscated stack trace</b> text area allows to enter the stack
    trace, typically by copying and pasting it from elsewhere. Alternatively,
    it can be loaded from a file by means of the load button below.
</ul>

There are two buttons at the bottom:
<p>

<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td class="button">Load stack trace...</td>
    <td>opens a file chooser to load an obfuscated stack trace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="button">ReTrace!</td>
    <td>executes ReTrace with the current settings.</td></tr>
</table>
