<h2>Usage</h2>

To run ProGuard, just type:
<p class="code">
<code><b>java -jar proguard.jar </b></code><i>options</i> ...
</p>
Options can also be put in one or more configuration files. Typically, you'll
put most options in a configuration file, and just call:
<p class="code">
<code><b>java -jar proguard.jar @myconfig.pro</b></code>
</p>
where <code>myconfig.pro</code> contains the actual options.
<p>
You can simply combine command line options and options from configuration
files, e.g.:
<p class="code">
<code><b>java -jar proguard.jar @myconfig.pro -printmapping</b></code>
</p>
<p>
In a configuration file, a <code><b>#</b></code> sign and all remaining
characters on that line are ignored, allowing you to add comments.
<p>
Extra whitespace between words and delimiters is ignored. To specify file names
with spaces or special characters, or more exotically, to specify empty class
names, words can be quoted with single or double quotes. Note that the quotes
may need to be escaped when used on the command line, to avoid gobbling by the
shell.
<p>
Options can be grouped arbitrarily in arguments on the command line and in
lines in configuration files. This means that you can quote any arbitrary
section of command line options, to avoid shell expansion of special
characters, for instance.
<p>
The order of  the options is irrelevant. They can be abbreviated to their first
unique characters.
<p>

<a name="options">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Options</h2>

The following table lists all ProGuard options:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><code><b>@</b></code><a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Short for '<code>-include</code> <i>filename</i>'.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="include"><code><b>-include</b></code></a>
    <a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Recursively reads configuration commands from the given file
    <i>filename</i>.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="libraryjars"><code><b>-libraryjars</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies the library jars (or directories) of the application to be
    processed. The class files in these jars will not be included in the
    output jar. The specified library jars should at least contain the class
    files that are <i>extended</i> by application class files. Library class
    files that are only <i>called</i> needn't be present. The files in the
    class path can be filtered based on their names, as explained in the class
    path section. It is allowed to specify multiple <code>-libraryjars</code>
    options.
    <p>
    Please note that the boot path and class path set for running ProGuard are
    not considered when looking for library classes. This means that you
    explicitly have to specify the run-time jar that your code will use.
    Although seemingly cumbersome, it allows you to process applications
    targeted at different run-time environments. For example, you can process
    <a href="examples.html#application">J2SE applications</a> as well as <a
    href="examples.html#midlet">J2ME midlets</a>, just by specifying the
    appropriate run-time jar.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="injars"><code><b>-injars</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies the program jars (or directories) of the application to be
    processed. The class files in these jars will be processed and merged in
    the output jar. Any non-class files will be copied over as well, unless
    you specify a <code>-resourcejars</code> option. Please be aware of any
    temporary files (e.g. created by IDEs), especially if you are reading your
    input files straight from directories. The files in the class path can be
    filtered based on their names, as explained in the class path section. It
    is allowed to specify multiple <code>-injars</code> options.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="resourcejars"><code><b>-resourcejars</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies any resource jars (or directories) to be copied into the output
    jar. Only non-class files in these jars will be copied. The files in the
    class path can be filtered based on their names, as explained in the class
    path section. It is allowed to specify multiple <code>-resourcejars</code>
    options. Without this option, the resource files from the program jars (or
    directories) will be copied.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="outjars"><code><b>-outjars</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classpath"><i>class_path</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies the name of the output jar or jars (or existing directories, for
    writing individual class files). The output files can be filtered based
    on their names, as explained in the class path section. Each processed
    class file or resource file is then written to the first output jar with a
    matching filter. It is allowed to specify multiple <code>-outjars</code>
    options. The output files must never overwrite any input files. Without
    this option, no jars or class files will be written.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keep"><code><b>-keep</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies classes and class members (fields and methods) to be preserved.
    They will be preserved with their original names. This is typically the
    required seed for recursively determining which other classes and class
    members need to be preserved. For example, in order to <a
    href="examples.html#application">keep an application</a>, you can specify
    the main class along with its main method. In order to <a
    href="examples.html#library">process a library</a>, you should specify all
    publicly accessible items.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepclassmembers"><code><b>-keepclassmembers</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies class members to be preserved, if their classes are preserved as
    well. For example, you may want to <a
    href="examples.html#serializable">keep all serialization fields and
    methods</a> of classes that implement the <code>Serializable</code>
    interface.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepclasseswithmembers"><code><b>-keepclasseswithmembers</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies classes and class members to be preserved, on the condition that
    all of the specified class members are present. For example, you may want
    to <a href="examples.html#applications">keep all applications</a> that
    have a main method, without having to list them explicitly.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepnames"><code><b>-keepnames</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies classes and class members whose names are to be preserved, if
    they aren't removed in the shrinking phase. For example, you may want to
    <a href="examples.html#serializable">keep all class names</a> of classes
    that implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface, so that the
    processed code remains compatible with any originally serialized classes.
    Classes that aren't used at all can still be removed.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepclassmembernames"><code><b>-keepclassmembernames</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies class members whose names are to be preserved, if they aren't
    removed in the shrinking phase. For example, you may want to preserve the
    name of the synthetic <code>class$</code> methods when <a
    href="examples.html#library">processing a library</a>, so ProGuard can
    detect it again when processing an application that uses the processed
    library.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepclasseswithmembernames"><code><b>-keepclasseswithmembernames</b></code></a>
    <a href="#classspecification"><i>class_specification</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies classes and class members whose names are to be preserved, on
    the condition that all of the specified class members are present after
    the shrinking phase. For example, you may want to <a
    href="examples.html#native">keep all native method names</a> and the names
    of their classes, so that the processed code can still link with the
    native library code. Native methods that aren't used at all can still be
    removed. If a class file is used, but none of its native methods are, its
    name will still be obfuscated.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="keepattributes"><code><b>-keepattributes</b></code></a>
    [<i>attribute_name<b>,</b>...</i>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies any optional attributes to be preserved. The attributes can be
    specified with one or more <code>-keepattributes</code> directives.
    Multiple attributes can also be specified separated by commas. An empty
    list or a <code><b>*</b></code> wildcard preserves all attributes. Typical
    optional attributes are <code>LineNumberTable</code>,
    <code>LocalVariableTable</code>, <code>SourceFile</code>,
    <code>SourceDir</code>, <code>Deprecated</code>, <code>Synthetic</code>,
    and <code>Signature</code>. The <code>InnerClasses</code> attribute name
    can be specified as well, referring to the source name part of this
    attribute. For example, you could keep the <code>Deprecated</code>
    attribute when <a href="examples.html#library">processing a library</a>.
    Only applicable when obfuscating.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="renamesourcefileattribute"><code><b>-renamesourcefileattribute</b></code></a>
    [<i>string</i>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies a constant string to be put in the <code>SourceFile</code>
    attributes (and <code>SourceDir</code> attributes) of the class files.
    Note that the attribute has to be present to start with, so it also has to
    be preserved explicitly using the <code>-keepattributes</code> directive.
    For example, you may want to have your processed libraries and
    applications produce <a href="examples.html#stacktrace">useful obfuscated
    stack traces</a>. Only applicable when obfuscating.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="printseeds"><code><b>-printseeds</b></code></a>
    [<a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to exhaustively list classes and class members matched by the
    various <code>-keep</code> commands. The list is printed to the standard
    output or to the given file. The list can be useful to verify if the
    intended class members are really found, especially if you're using
    wildcards. For example, you may want to list all the <a
    href="examples.html#applications">applications</a> or all the <a
    href="examples.html#applets">applets</a> that you are keeping.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="printusage"><code><b>-printusage</b></code></a>
    [<a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to list dead code of the input class files. The list is printed
    to the standard output or to the given file. For example, you can <a
    href="examples.html#deadcode">list the unused code of an application</a>.
    Only applicable when shrinking.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="printmapping"><code><b>-printmapping</b></code></a>
    [<a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to print the mapping from old names to new names for classes and
    class members that have been renamed. The mapping is printed to the
    standard output or to the given file. It is required for subsequent
    incremental obfuscation, or if you ever want to make sense again of <a
    href="examples.html#stacktrace">obfuscated stack traces</a>. Only
    applicable when obfuscating.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="applymapping"><code><b>-applymapping</b></code></a>
    <a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to reuse the given name mapping that was printed out in a
    previous obfuscation run of ProGuard. Classes and class members that are
    listed in the mapping file receive the names specified along with them.
    Classes and class members that are not mentioned receive new names. This
    option can be useful for incremental obfuscation, i.e. processing add-ons
    or small patches to an existing piece of code. Only applicable when
    obfuscating.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="verbose"><code><b>-verbose</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to write out some more information during processing. If the
    program terminates with an exception, this option will print out the entire
    stack trace, instead of just the exception message.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dump"><code><b>-dump</b></code></a>
    [<a href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to write out the internal structure of the class files, after
    any processing. The structure is printed to the standard output or to the
    given file. For example, you may want to <a
    href="examples.html#structure">write out the contents of a given jar
    file</a>, without shrinking or obfuscating it first.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="ignorewarnings"><code><b>-ignorewarnings</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to print any warnings about unresolved references to
    superclasses, interfaces, or class members, but to continue processing in
    any case. If the classes or class members are indeed required for
    processing, the output jar will not function properly. Only use this
    option if you know what you're doing!<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontwarn"><code><b>-dontwarn</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to warn about unresolved references at all. Again, if the
    unresolved classes or class members are indeed required for processing,
    the output jar will not function properly. Only use this option if you
    know what you're doing!<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontnote"><code><b>-dontnote</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to print notes about class casts of variable dynamically
    created objects. These notes provide hints about classes that may have to
    be kept.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontshrink"><code><b>-dontshrink</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to shrink the input class files. By default, shrinking is
    applied: all classes and class members are removed, except for the ones
    listed by the various <code>-keep</code> commands, and the ones they
    depend on, recursively.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontobfuscate"><code><b>-dontobfuscate</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to obfuscate the input class files. By default, obfuscation
    is applied: classes and class members receive new short random names,
    except for the ones listed by the various <code>-keep</code> commands.
    Internal attributes that are useful for debugging, such as source files
    names, variable names, and line numbers are removed.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontusemixedcaseclassnames"><code><b>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to generate mixed-case class names while obfuscating. By
    default, obfuscated class names can contain a mix of upper-case characters
    and lower-case characters. This creates perfectly acceptable and usable
    jars. Only if a jar is unpacked on a platform with a case-insensitive
    filing system (say, Windows), the unpacking tool may let similarly named
    class files overwrite each other. Code that self-destructs when it's
    unpacked! Developers who really want to unpack their jars on Windows can
    use this option to switch off this behavior. Note that the obfuscated jars
    will become larger as a result. Only applicable when obfuscating.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="overloadaggressively"><code><b>-overloadaggressively</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to apply aggressive overloading while obfuscating. Multiple
    fields and methods can then get the same names, as long as their arguments
    and return types are different (not just their arguments, in the case of
    methods). This option can make the output jar even smaller (and less
    comprehensible). Only applicable when obfuscating.
    <p>
    Note that the resulting class files fall within the Java bytecode
    specification (cfr. <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html"
    >The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition</a>, first
    paragraphs of <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#2877"
    >Section 4.5</a> and <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#1513"
    >Section 4.6</a>), even though this kind of overloading is not allowed in
    the Java language (cfr. <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html"
    >The Java Language Specification, Second Edition</a>, <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/classes.doc.html#40898"
    >Section 8.3</a> and <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/classes.doc.html#227768"
    >Section 8.4.7</a>). Still, some tools have problems with it. Most
    notably, Sun's JDK 1.2.2 javac compiler produces an exception when
    compiling with such a library (cfr. <a href=
    "http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4216736.html">Bug
    #4216736</a>). You therefore probably shouldn't use this option for
    processing libraries.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="defaultpackage"><code><b>-defaultpackage</b></code></a>
    [<i>package_name</i>]<p></dt>

<dd>Specifies to repackage all class files that are renamed into the single
    given package. Without argument or with an empty string (''), the package
    is removed completely. This option can make the output jar even smaller
    (and less comprehensible). Only applicable when obfuscating.
    <p>
    Note that this kind of repackaging could cause access permissions to
    become inconsistent, e.g. a class with default access may move to a
    different package from some other class that is using it. Although this is
    formally allowed by Java's binary compatibility specifications (cfr. <a
    href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html"
    >The Java Language Specification, Second Edition</a>, <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/binaryComp.doc.html#47259"
    >Section 13.4.6</a>), some virtual machines have problems with it.
    ProGuard works around it by making package visible classes and class
    members public, if this option is being used. These changes don't affect
    the functioning of applications. It might be confusing and therefore less
    desirable when processing libraries.
    <p>
    Counter-indications: classes that look for resource files in their package
    directories will no longer work properly if they are moved elsewhere. When
    in doubt, just leave the packaging untouched by not using this
    option.<p></dd>

<dt><a name="dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses"><code><b>-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses</b></code></a><p></dt>

<dd>Specifies not to ignore non-public library classes. By default, non-public
    library classes are skipped while parsing library jars. The classes are
    typically not relevant during processing, since they don't affect the
    actual program code in the input jars. Ignoring them reduces memory usage
    and processing time. Occasionally, a badly designed library may contain a
    non-public library class that is extended/implemented by a public library
    class. If the latter library class in turn is extended/implemented by a
    program class, ProGuard will complain that it can't find the non-public
    library class, which it had ignored during parsing. This option will
    overcome that problem, at the cost of greater memory usage and longer
    processing time.<p></dd>

</dl>
<p>

<a name="keepoptions">&nbsp;</a>
<h2><code>-keep</code> Options</h2>

The various <code>-keep</code> options may seem a bit confusing at first, but
there's actually a pattern behind them. The following table summarizes how they
are related:
<p>

<table cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<th>Keep</th>
<td>From shrinking &amp; obfuscation</td>
<td>From obfuscation only</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Classes and class members</td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keep</code></td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keepnames</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Class members only</td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keepclassmembernames</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Classes and class members, if class members present</td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keepclasseswithmembers</code></td>
<td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><code>-keepclasseswithmembernames</code></td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>

Each of these <code>-keep</code> options is of course followed by a
<a href="#classspecification">specification</a> of the classes and class
members to which it should be applied.
<p>
If you're not sure which option you need, you should probably simply use 
<code>-keep</code>. It will make sure the specified classes and class members
are preserved from shrinking and from obfuscation.
<p>

<a name="classpath">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Class Paths</h2>

ProGuard uses class paths to specify its input files and its output files. As
in Java, a class path consists of <a href="#filename">file names</a> of one or
more jars or directories, separated by the path separator (e.g. '<b>:</b>' on
Unix, or '<b>;</b>' on Windows platforms).
<p>
In addition, ProGuard provides the possibility to filter the files in the class
path, based on the file names. Each jar or diectory can be followed by a
filter between parentheses. A filter consists of one or more comma-separated
file names that can contain wildcards. Only files with matching file names are
read (in the case of input jars), or written (in the case of output jars). The
following wildcards are supported:

<table cellspacing="10">
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>?</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any single character in a file name.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>*</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any part of a filename not containing the directory
        separator.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>**</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any part of a filename, possibly containing any number of
        directory separators.</td></tr>
</table>

For example, "<code>rt.jar(java/**.class,javax/**.class)</code>" matches all
class files in the <code>java</code> and <code>javax</code> directories inside
the <code>rt</code> jar.
<p>

Furthermore, a file name can be preceded by an exclamation mark '<b>!</b>' to
<i>exclude</i> the file name from further attempts to match with
<i>subsequent</i> file names.
<p>
For example, "<code>input.jar(!images/**,**)</code>" matches all files, except
those in the <code>images</code> directory, inside the <code>input</code> jar.
<p>

<a name="filename">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>File Names</h2>

ProGuard accepts absolute paths and relative paths for the various file names,
jar names, and directories.
<p>
The names can contain Java system properties delimited by '<b>&lt;</b>' and
'<b>&gt;</b>'. The system properties
are automatically replaced by their respective values.
<p>
For example, <code>&lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar</code> will automatically be
expanded to something like <code>/usr/local/java/jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar</code>.
<p>
Names with special characters like spaces and parentheses should be quoted
with single or double quotes. Note that each file name in a list of names has
to be quoted individually. Also note that the quotes may need to be escaped
when used on the command line, to avoid gobbling by the shell.
<p>
For example, on the command line, you could use an option like <code>'-injars
"my program.jar":"/your directory/your program.jar"'</code>.
<p>

<a name="classspecification">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Class Specifications</h2>

A class specification is a template of classes and class members (fields and
methods). It is used in the various <code>-keep</code> options. The
corresponding option is only applied to classes and class members that match
the template.
<p>
The template was designed to look very Java-like, with some extensions for
wildcards. To get a feel for the syntax, you should probably look at the <a
href="examples.html">examples</a>, but this is an attempt at a complete formal
definition:
<p>

<pre>
[[<b>!</b>]<b>public</b>|<b>final</b>|<b>abstract</b> ...] ([<b>!</b>]<b>interface</b>)|<b>class</b> <i>classname</i>
    [<b>extends</b>|<b>implements</b> <i>classname</i>]
[<b>{</b>
    [[<b>!</b>]<b>public</b>|<b>private</b>|<b>protected</b>|<b>static</b>|<b>volatile</b>|<b>transient</b> ...] <b>&lt;fields&gt;</b> |
                                                                      (<i>fieldtype fieldname</i>)<b>;</b>
    [[<b>!</b>]<b>public</b>|<b>private</b>|<b>protected</b>|<b>static</b>|<b>synchronized</b>|<b>native</b>|<b>abstract</b>|<b>strictfp</b> ...] <b>&lt;methods&gt;</b> |
                                                                                           <b>&lt;init&gt;(</b><i>argumenttype,...</i><b>)</b> |
                                                                                           <i>classname</i><b>(</b><i>argumenttype,...</i><b>)</b> |
                                                                                           (<i>returntype methodname</i><b>(</b><i>argumenttype,...</i><b>)</b>)<b>;</b>
    [[<b>!</b>]<b>public</b>|<b>private</b>|<b>protected</b>|<b>static</b> ... ] <b>*;</b>
    ...
<b>}</b>]
</pre>
<p>
Square brackets "[]" mean that something is optional. Ellipsis dots "..." mean
that any number of items may be specified. A vertical bar "|" indicates a
choice between alternatives. Non-bold parentheses "()" just group parts of the
specification that belong together. The indentation tries to clarify the
intended meaning, but white-space is irrelevant in actual configuration files.
<p>
<ul>

<li>The <code><b>class</b></code> keyword refers to any interface or class.
    The <code><b>interface</b></code> keyword restricts matches to interface
    classes. Preceding the <code><b>interface</b></code> keyword by a
    <code><b>!</b></code> restricts matches to classes that are not
    interfaces.
    <p>

<li>Every <i>classname</i> must be fully qualified, e.g.
    <code>java.lang.String</code>. Class names may be specified as regular
    expressions containing the following wildcards:

<table cellspacing="10">

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>?</b></code></td>

<td>matches any single character in a class name, but not the package
    separator. For example, "<code>mypackage.Test?</code>" matches
    "<code>mypackage.Test1</code>" and "<code>mypackage.Test2</code>", but not
    "<code>mypackage.Test12</code>".</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>*</b></code></td>

<td>matches any part of a class name not containing the package separator. For
    example, "<code>mypackage.*Test*</code>" matches
    "<code>mypackage.Test</code>" and
    "<code>mypackage.YourTestApplication</code>", but not
    "<code>mypackage.mysubpackage.MyTest</code>". Or, more generally,
    "<code>mypackage.*</code>" matches all classes in
    "<code>mypackage</code>", but not in its subpackages.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>**</b></code></td>

<td>matches any part of a class name, possibly containing any number of
    package separators. For example, "<code>**.Test</code>" matches all
    <code>Test</code> classes in all packages except the root package. Or,
    "<code>mypackage.**</code>" matches all classes in
    "<code>mypackage</code>" and in its subpackages.</td></tr>

</table>

    For convenience and for backward compatibility, the class name
    <code><b>*</b></code> refers to any class, irrespective of its package.
    <p>

<li>The <code><b>extends</b></code> and <code><b>implements</b></code>
    specifications are typically used to restrict classes with wildcards. They
    are currently equivalent, specifying that only classes extending or
    implementing the given class qualify. Note that the given class itself is
    not included in this set. If required, it should be specified in a
    separate option.
    <p>

<li>Fields and methods are specified much like in Java, except that method
    argument lists don't contain argument names. The specifications can also
    contain the following catch-all wildcards:

<table cellspacing="10">

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>&lt;init&gt;</b></code></td>
<td>matches any constructor.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>&lt;fields&gt;</b></code></td>
<td>matches any field.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>&lt;methods&gt;</b></code></td>
<td>matches any method.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>*</b></code></td>
<td>matches any field or method.</td></tr>

</table>

    Note that the above wildcards don't have return types. Only the
    <code><b>&lt;init&gt;</b></code> wildcard has an argument list.
    <p>

    Fields and methods may also be specified using regular expressions. Names
    can contain the following wildcards:

<table cellspacing="10">
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>?</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any single character in a method name.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>*</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any part of a method name.</td></tr>
</table>

    Types in descriptors can contain the following wildcards:

<table cellspacing="10">
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>?</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any single character in a class name.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>*</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any part of a class name not containing the package                     separator.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>**</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any part of a class name, possibly containing any number of
        package separators.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><code><b>%</b></code></td>
    <td>matches any primitive type ("<code>boolean</code>", "<code>int</code>",
        etc, but not "<code>void</code>").</td></tr>
</table>

    Note that the <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>**</code>
    wildcards will never match primitive types. None of the wildcards will
    match array types of different dimensions than specified by the regular
    expression. For example, "<code>** get*()</code>" matches
    "<code>java.lang.Object getObject()</code>", but not "<code>float
    getFloat()</code>", nor "<code>java.lang.Object[] getObjects()</code>".
    <p>

<li>Constructors can also be specified using their short class name (without
    package) or using their full class name. As in the Java language, the
    constructor specification has an argument list, but no return type.
    <p>

<li>The class access modifiers and class member access modifiers are typically
    used to restrict wildcarded classes and class members. They specify that
    the corresponding access flags have to be set for the member to match. A
    preceding <code><b>!</b></code> specifies that the corresponding access
    flag should be unset.
    <p>
    Combining multiple flags is allowed (e.g. <code>public static</code>). It
    means that both access flags have to be set (e.g. <code>public</code>
    <i>and</i> <code>static</code>), except when they are conflicting, in
    which case at least one of them has to be set (e.g. at least
    <code>public</code>
    <i>or</i> <code>protected</code>).
