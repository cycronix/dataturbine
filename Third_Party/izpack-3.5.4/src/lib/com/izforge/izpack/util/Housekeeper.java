 * It is VERY important to perform pre-shutdown cleanup operations through
 * this class. Do NOT rely on operations like <code>deleteOnExit()</code>
 * shutdown hooks or <code>finalize()</code>for cleanup. Because
 * <code>shutDown()</code> uses <code>System.exit()</code> to terminate,
 * these methods will not work at all or will not work reliably.
