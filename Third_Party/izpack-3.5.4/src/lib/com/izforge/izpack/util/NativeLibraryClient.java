  * This method is used to free the library at the end of progam execution.
  * After this call, any instance of this calss will not be usable any more!
  * <b><i><u>This method is very likely NOT to return!</u></i></b>
  * <br><br>
  * <b>DO NOT CALL THIS METHOD DIRECTLY!</b><br>
  * It is used by the librarian to free a native library before physically
  * deleting it from its temporary loaction. A call to this method is
  * likely to irrecoverably freeze the application!
  * <br><br>
  * The contract for this method implementation is that a call will bring the
  * native library into a state where it can be deleted. This translates into
  * an operation to free the library. Since no libraries should be left
  * behind when the installer shuts down, it is necessary that each library
  * provides the means to free itself. For instance in a MS-Windows environment
  * the library must call <code>FreeLibraryAndExitThread()</code>. This will
  * result in a native fuction call that does not return.
  *
  * @param      name    the name of the library, without path but with extension
