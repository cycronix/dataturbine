  <h1>IzPack overview</h1>
  
  <h2>What it can do for you</h2>
  <p>IzPack is a powerful software installers generator for the Java[tm]
  platform. It uses a very modular architecture that lets you make the
  installers work as you want, not as the software wants it to work. It is also
  possible to extend it to suit your needs since it has been designed with this
  purpose in mind from the start.</p>
  
  <h2>Package once, install anywhere</h2>
  <p>The installers generated by IzPack are independant of the target operating
  system. It has been running successfully on Linux/i386, FreeBSD, Solaris,
  MacOS X and Win32. All it needs is a Java[tm] Runtime Environment.
  Unfortunately, there is no Java[tm] Runtime Environment that is available
  under an OSI-approved license. The recent news from the Java[tm] community
  suggest that it will never be the case. This is a shame as it restricts both
  your freedom and the number of supported platforms.</p>
  
  <h2>Cool licensing</h2>
  <p>IzPack is published under the GNU GPL which is a Free Software license as
  defined by both the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative.
  This means that you can freely redistribute and modify IzPack as long as you
  respect the GNU GPL terms.</p>
