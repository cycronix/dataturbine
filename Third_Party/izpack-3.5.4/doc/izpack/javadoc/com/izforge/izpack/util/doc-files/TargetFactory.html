<H2>How to use the TargetFactory</H2>

Here is a simple approach that you can use to automatically instantiate
flavors of your class that are tailored to a specific operating system. 
If necessary you can even have different versions for different flavors
of an operating system, such as Windows-NT. 
<br><br>
Implement your API with the class name that you would like to use. The
API can be implemented as interface, a partially or completely abastact
class or a complete class implementation. The choice is your's and
primarily depends your specific needs. However, it seems likely that in
most cases it will be necessary to have a default implementation that
can be instantiated if an appropriate flavor does not exist for some
reason. One situation might be that a special version is not needed for
all the different OS/OS-Flavor combinations but only for one or two
cases. For all other cases the default implementation might work just
fine. Another reason would be that an installation is attempted on an OS
that is unknown or is not listed and as a fallback position a default
implementation of the class should be available. For the following I
assume that a complete implementation is used.
<br><br>
In the next step you need to derive one class for each of the different
flavors you want to support with specific implementations. All of these
classes must be contained in the same package as the base class and must
follow a prescribed naming convention. Name prefixes are defined for a
number of operating systems and operating system flavores. Please review
the class documentation for <code>TargetFactory</code> for a a complete
list of these prefixes. 
<br><br>
Let's assume you have a class called <code>MyClass</code> in the package
<code>com.izforge.izpack.installer</code>. This class contains your
default implementation. For some reason you need modified functionality
for Mac OS X.  You would now implement the class
<code>Mac_X_MyClass</code> which is extending <code>MyClass</code> and
implements the necessary differences. This is all you need to do on the
implementation end.
<br><br>
To get the correct instance based on the OS, simply call
<code>makeObject()</code>. This example illustrates the call:<br>
<PRE>
  <font size=2 color=000000>TargetFactory.<b>getInstance</b> ().<b>makeObject</b> (</font><font size=2 color=FF0000>"com.izforge.izpack.installer.MyClass"</font><font size=2 color=000000>);</font>
</PRE>
This call will return an instance of the proper flavor, without worry
about the OS on your part. More specifically, you will recive an
instance of <code>MyClass</code> on all operating systems, except on Mac
OS X, in which case you will  receive an instance of
<code>Mac_X_MyClass</code>. To make this work,
<code>TargetFactory</code> will automatically map the correct name and
create an instance for you.
<H3>The Constructor</H3>
There is one drawback to this implementation that you must be aware of.
Because of the way how instances are created, each class must have a
default constructor. Of course this is done either by not implementing a
constructor or by implementing a constructor without parameters (this
must not be private). This constructor will be used when instances are 
created. As a result, you can not pass parameters to the constructor.
<br><br>
If you need to create instances that perform initial operations based on
a set of parameters, I recommend the following approach. Instead of a
constructor implement a method called <code>initialize()</code>. Call
<code>makeObject()</code> to get your instance and then call
<code>initialize()</code> with your parameters before using that object.
