                Ant Task for doxygen
                ====================

1.What is this package ?
   This package contains the  ant task to use the software doxygen.
   
2. What is doxygen ?
    From the web-site of doxygen - 
    
"Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, IDL
(Corba, Microsoft, and KDE-DCOP flavors) and to some extend PHP.

It can help you in three ways:

It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) 
and/or an off-line reference manual (in ) from a set of 
documented source files. There is also support for generating output 
in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML,
and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, 
which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.

Doxygen can be configured to extract the code structure from undocumented 
source files. This can be very useful to quickly find your way in large source
distributions. The relations between the various elements are be visualized 
by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration 
diagrams, which are all generated automatically.

You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for this manual).

Doxygen is developed under Linux, but is set-up to be highly portable. 
As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore,
executables for Windows 9x/NT and Mac OS X are available."

3. Where can I get the distribution of doxygen ? 
   Visit http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ to get the latest release.

4.What version of doxygen does this one support ? 
   The task, rewritten as per v1.3 makes sure that , the task is independent of 
the version of doxygen that you are running. 

5.What is the license under which this is issued? 
   This software is issued under The Apache Software License, Version 1.1. 
Please see the file LICENSE for more details.

6. Doxygen provides me a host of options. Does the task support all of them ?

   Yeah. The task supports all of them. If not please log a bug / feature request 
as appropriate. 

7. How do I know of the latest releases of the ant-doxygen task ? 

   The mailing list - ant-doxygen-release@lists.sourceforge.net is notified of latest 
releases of the task . This is a low-traffic mailing list. 
  To subscribe to the same, please visit - 

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ant-doxygen-release . 

8. Enough is enough. Please let me know how to write a doxygen task. 
   A sample task is provided in the file build.xml distributed along with this,
   under target testtask.

   <target name="tasktest" depends="makejar"   >
        <taskdef name="doxygen" classname="org.doxygen.tools.DoxygenTask"
            classpath="./lib/doxygen_ant.jar" />
            
        <mkdir dir="${testoutputdir}" />            
        <doxygen>
            <property name="INPUT" value="${testinputdir}" />
            <property name="OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" value="{testoutputdir}" /> 
        </doxygen>
   </target>

   
 If you feel the task has a bug/feature requests please visit the following page 
and log appropriate patches / bug requests .
