Release Notes for the RC Scripts Zip File
-----------------------------------------

The RC scripts zip file contains the following:

	- README			this file
	- rbnb				the DataTurbine rc script
	- webturbine			the WebTurbine rc script
	- utility-apps.jar		RBNB utility applications


The rbnb and webturbine scripts allow for the automatic starting of the
DataTurbine and WebTurbine servers at system startup, and for the termination
of those servers at system shutdown.

The utility-apps.jar file contains a pair of RBNB applications used by the rbnb
script:

	1) ServerStatus			checks to see if the server is
					running and sets the exit status as
					follows:

						0 - server is running and
						    allowed a sink connection,
						    or
					       -1 - server is not running or
						    did not allow a sink
						    connection.

	2) TerminateServer		terminates the RBNB server.

Both of these take a single switch:

	-a <server address>		specifies the address of the RBNB
					server, default is localhost:3333.


Installation
------------

To install and use the rbnb and webturbine startup/shutdown scripts, perform
the following steps:

1) Unpack the ZIP file into a temporary directory as the RBNB installation
   owner:

	% cd /tmp
	% unzip rbnb-rc-scripts.zip

2) Change to the superuser:

	% su

3) Move the rbnb and webturbine scripts to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory:

	% mv rbnb webturbine /etc/rc.d/init.d

4) Create symbolic links to start/stop the DataTurbine and WebTurbine servers
   at the proper init levels.  We use the following setup:

	Single user mode:
	% cd /etc/rc.d/rc1.d
	% ln -s ../init.d/rbnb K70rbnb
	% ln -s ../init.d/webturbine K70webturbine

	Multiuser mode without graphics or networking:
	% cd /etc/rc.d/rc2.d
	% ln -s ../init.d/rbnb K70rbnb
	% ln -s ../init.d/webturbine K70webturbine

	Multiuser mode without graphics:
	% cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
	% ln -s ../init.d/rbnb S99rbnb
	% ln -s ../init.d/webturbine S99webturbine

	Multiuser mode with graphics:
	% cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
	% ln -s ../init.d/rbnb S99rbnb
	% ln -s ../init.d/webturbine S99webturbine

	Reboot:
	% cd /etc/rc.d/rc6.d
	% ln -s ../init.d/rbnb K70rbnb
	% ln -s ../init.d/webturbine K70webturbine

   Init level 4 is not used on our system.

5) Change back to the RBNB installation owner (if not root):

	% exit

6) Move the utility-apps.jar file to the ${RBNB_HOME}/bin directory:

	% mv utility-apps.jar ${RBNB_HOME}/bin

   Where ${RBNB_HOME} should be replaced with the RBNB installation directory
   (such as /home/RBNB_V2.3).

Once these steps are done, the DataTurbine server and the WebTurbine server
will automatically start whenever the system is booted and will terminate when
the system goes down.


Limitations
-----------

In order to run the GUI applications, the WebTurbine server needs to be able to
access the console X server to be able to run properly.  We got this working,
but with some limitations on what you can do on the console.  In particular,
the webturbine script is tied to a particular user being logged into the
console and running X (the default in the script is root).  The following notes
describe how this limits the system:

1) If no one ever logs into the console, then applications with GUIs (such as
   rbnbAdmin, rbnbPlot, etc.) cannot be run via the WebTurbine,

2) If the proper user (root by default) logs into the console, the GUI
   applications will run

3) Once a GUI application has been run, logging off the console (which causes
   the X server to terminate and restart) terminates the WebTurbine.  You will
   need to relaunch it by hand.  This can be done using the commands:

	% cd ${RBNB_HOME}/bin
	% ./Start_Webserver.sh

These limitations make launching the WebTurbine at startup problematic and we
have turned off the X capability in the script by default.  The GUI
applications will not work (they will produce errors).

Note: if you wish to be able to use the GUI applications with the limitations
      described, then take out the comment (#) marker on the lines that say:

	#XAUTHORITY=/root/.Xauthority
	#export XAUTHORITY

      if you wish to change which user the WebTurbine requires, edit the line
      to:

	XAUTHORITY=${user-home-directory}/.Xauthority

     where:

	${user-home-directory} is the path to the home directory of the user
	you wish to control the WebTurbine server.
