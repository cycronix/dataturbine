     Description:
         This file contains various properties for compiling the RBNB source
	 code.  It is designed to be used with an "import" statement by build
	 files in directories below the current one.
	 
	 ***  History  ***
	 2007/08/23  PFH  Removed proguard, adding Doxygen
	 2004/12/28  WHF  Added rbnb.javaver property. 
	 2007/08/17  JPW  Since Third_Party directory has been moved outside of
	                  Source, I changed the definition of
			  "rbnb.thirdpartydir".  Add a check that Third_Party
			  exists in proper location (fail build if it isn't).
	 2009/04/29  WHF  Added rbnb.thirdpartyout, rbnb.tomcatver.
	 2011/07/29  JPW  Changed Tomcat version from 6.0.18 to 7.0.19;
	                  to compile with Tomcat 7, changed rbnb.javaver from
	                  1.4 to 1.5.
