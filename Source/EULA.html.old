<B><FONT FACE="Times"><P>1. LICENSE GRANT.</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2> LICENSOR grants LICENSEE a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, and non-assignable license to use the SOFTWARE free of charge provided that LICENSEE has downloaded a copy from the RBNB Web site and accepts and acknowledges that such free-of-charge SOFTWARE may not include all of the features or functionality provided with the SOFTWARE provided under a purchased license. Similarly, such free-of-charge SOFTWARE may not be fully interoperable with the SOFTWARE provided under a purchased license. Should such free-of-charge SOFTWARE be provided with a limited duration demonstration license, LICENSEE agrees to not use SOFTWARE past the expiration date of said demonstration license. If LICENSEE is using the SOFTWARE free of charge, LICENSEE is not entitled to support or telephone assistance. LICENSEE is entitled to access on-line RBNB documentation as may be provided, at Creare’s sole discretion, at the RBNB Web site.
