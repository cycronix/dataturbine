To run on the Mac:

Install the JMF jar files from $JMFHOME/lib to the java ext folder:

/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/Home/lib/ext
(jmf.properties may need to go in lib folder, but doesn't seem to matter)

using explicit or environment CLASSPATH is dicey at best for some reason.
