This folder contains testrbnb JUNIT tests. They roughly follow the Matlab test suite.

Hierarchy:

AllTests
	testopen
	testput
	etc
		
Each test extends testrbnb wrapper that runs each test.

See test_template.java for outline for creating new test class.

To compile stand-alone test-runner, in Eclipse "Export" AllTests.java to runnable jar file.
