<h1>Resample PlugIn Help</h1>
The Resample PlugIn is useful for reducing the sample rate of a data stream
in order to reduce network load.
<p>It will take time series data in an RBNB channel,
and either limit the data to a maximum number of samples 
(via the <b>Max points per request</b> parameter) by decimating the data,
or it will apply a fixed decimation factor 
(through the <b>Downsample factor</b> parameter).
If the sample limit requirement
calls for a higher decimation factor than the fixed factor, the higher factor
will be used.
<p>For example, say the Resample PlugIn is started with 
a Downsample factor of 2 and a Max points value of 1000. 
If a request is then made for 1000 points, 500 points would be returned
because the downsample factor of 2 would be used.  If a request were made
for 3000 points, 1000 points would be returned because the limit would
establish a factor of 3.  Note that only integer decimations are currently
supported.
<p>The Resample PlugIn also features an anti-aliasing capability.  An 8 pole
Butterworth low pass filter is used, with a breakpoint frequency at the 
Nyquist frequency of the downsampled data stream.  This filter does have a
noticeable startup transient.
