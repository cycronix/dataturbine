<h1>Signature PlugIn Help</h1>
Signature PlugIn adds a signature to any response made through
it.&nbsp; It does this by adding a <span style="font-style: italic;">_signature</span>
channel to any response.<br>
<br>
Signature PlugIn also automatically checks and verifies signed
responses. It does this by verifying any <span
 style="font-style: italic;">_signature</span> channel it detects.<br>
<br>
You can setup a signature at both source and sink, and the sink can be
assured that any response it receives has a matching signature.
Responses that don't match a signature are rejected and a null response
is returned.
<br>
<br>
The signature is a message digest incorporating the source data, the
timestamp, and the signature-password provided upon
startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The signature password itself is never transmitted, it is a symmetric
secret key.<br>
<br>
A simple usage example is to use the same Signature plugin to both
generate and check a signature, as in: Signature/Signature/Source/chan.
