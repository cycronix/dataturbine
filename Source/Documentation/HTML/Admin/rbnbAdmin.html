<h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
<h2>
<a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<i>rbnbAdmin</i> is a Java application which connects to a DataTurbine,
displays a "tree view" of its current connections, and allows the user
to perform certain administrative functions.&nbsp; The following figure
illustrates a sample <i>rbnbAdmin</i> user interface window:
<center>
<p><img src="rbnbAdmin.JPG" height="234" width="298"></p>
</center>
<p>Each object in the tree view has a representative icon.&nbsp; These
are shown and discussed in the section which follows.
</p>
<p>In addition to displaying the connected hierarchy of objects, <i>rbnbAdmin</i>
provides a variety of administrative control capabilities, which are
described
in following sections.&nbsp; These include:
</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;
  <table width="75%">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b><a href="#pulldowncontrols">Pull-Down Menu Controls</a></b></td>
        <td>to set connection and view options</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b><a href="#PopUpFunctions">Pop-Up Menu Controls</a></b></td>
        <td>to set object-related status and execute object-related
functions</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="setup"></a>Setup and Startup</h2>
<i>rbnbAdmin</i> needs to be run under a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). <i>rbnbAdmin</i>
has two optional command-line arguments which specify the server to
connect
to.&nbsp; The format of the command line looks like the following:
<blockquote><tt>java -jar admin.jar -n &lt;Server name&gt; -a
&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; -u &lt;user ID&gt;<br>
  </tt></blockquote>
If you start without the "-n", "-a", and "-u" arguments, use the
<a href="#file">File/Open</a>
selection to initiate a connection.
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h1><a name="treeviewinfo"></a>Tree View Information</h1>
The main panel of the <i>rbnbAdmin</i> window shows a hierarchical
tree-view
of the DataTurbine.&nbsp; The root node of the tree view (the node at
the
top) is the DataTurbine to which <i>rbnbAdmin</i> is connected.&nbsp;
Below
that, other connections of various types are shown, as described below.
<h2><img src="rbnb.gif" height="19" width="20">&nbsp;<a
 name="RBNBConnection"></a>DataTurbine</h2>
The root-level DataTurbine (i.e. the one to which you have connected)
is
shown as the top line of the tree-view display.&nbsp; The contents of
this
Server's registration map is added as a series of child nodes in the
tree
structure.
<p>The name shown for a DataTurbine object is of the form "&lt;<i>name&gt;
&lt;address&gt;</i>", where
<i>name</i> identifies the DataTurbine and <i>address</i>
describes how to connect to this DataTurbine.
</p>
<h2><img src="rco.gif" height="16" width="18">&nbsp;<a
 name="ControlConnection"></a>Control
Connection</h2>
Control connections exist for administrative functions.&nbsp; You
should
always be able to see the control connection created by <i>rbnbAdmin</i>
itself.&nbsp; Control connections associated with source and sink
connections
are not explicitly shown.&nbsp; In RBNB object parlance, a control
connection
corresponds to an RCO (Ring buffer Control Object).
<p>The name shown for a control connection is the name provided by the
control application to the DataTurbine.&nbsp; For <i>rbnbAdmin</i>,
this
name is hardwired to "Admin".&nbsp; If this name is not unique in the
DataTurbine,
an underscore and unique identifier number will be appended to the name
(for example, "Admin_3").
</p>
<h2><img src="nbo.gif" height="16" width="20">&nbsp;<a
 name="SinkConnection"></a>Data
Sink</h2>
A data sink connection exists for each connected application open for
"reading".&nbsp;
Data flows from the DataTurbine to data sink applications.&nbsp; In
RBNB
parlance, a sink connection corresponds to an NBO (Network Bus
Object).&nbsp;
The contents of this Sink's registration map are added as children to
this
Sink's node in the tree structure.
<p>The name shown for a sink connection is the name provided by the
sink
application to the DataTurbine.&nbsp; If this name is not unique in the
DataTurbine, an underscore and unique identifier number will be
appended
to the name.
</p>
<h2><img src="rbo.gif" height="17" width="20">&nbsp;<a
 name="SourceConnection"></a>Data
Source</h2>
A data source connection exists for each application which is "writing"
data to the DataTurbine.&nbsp; Data flows from a source application to
the DataTurbine.&nbsp; In RBNB parlance, a source connection
corresponds
to an RBO (Ring Buffer Object).&nbsp; The contents of this Source's
registration
map are added as children to this Source's node in the tree structure.
<p>It is also possible to have an data source (RBO) object for a data
source
which has disconnected (leaving data in the RBO), or for an archive
which
was loaded.
</p>
<p>The name shown for a source connection is the name provided by the
source
application to the DataTurbine.&nbsp; If this name is not unique in the
DataTurbine, an underscore and unique identifier number will be
appended
to the name.
</p>
<h2><img src="mirnbo.gif" height="16" width="20">&nbsp;<a
 name="MirrortoConnection"></a>Mirror
(To)</h2>
A data Mirror (To) object is associated with a data mirror which
streams
data from a Source in the local DataTurbine to a new RBO in either the
local or a remote DataTurbine.&nbsp; It may have been established by a
connected application, or by <i>rbnbAdmin</i> itself (see <a
 href="#mirrortopopup">below</a>).
<h2><img src="mirrbo.gif" height="16" width="20">&nbsp;<a
 name="MirrorFromConnection"></a>Mirror
(From)</h2>
A data Mirror (From) object is associated with a data mirror which
streams
data from a Source located in either the local or a remote DataTurbine
to an RBO in the local DataTurbine.&nbsp; It may have been established
by an application or by <i>rbnbAdmin</i> itself (see <a
 href="#dt_mirrorfrompopup">below</a>).
<h1>
<hr width="100%"></h1>
<h1>
<a name="pulldowncontrols"></a>Menu Bar</h1>
<i>rbnbAdmin</i> has the following pull-down menus.

<h3>
<a name="mirrordialogs"></a><b>Mirror Dialog</b></h3>
<b><i>Mirrors</i></b> cause data from a designated source (RBO) to be
automatically
sent to a different RBO in either the local or a remote
DataTurbine.&nbsp;
Thus, a copy of the selected source data is available at both the
original
source and the destination RBO.&nbsp; Mirrors differ from routing in
that
data is automatically sent without waiting for a sink request. The
mirror
is established in one of two ways:
<ul>
  <li>
"Pull" mirror: A request is made to one or more Sources (located in
either
the local or a remote DataTurbine) to establish a mirror with the local
DataTurbine.&nbsp; In <i>rbnbAdmin</i> this can be done by selecting
the
"Mirror from..." Pop-Up menu item on the top level DataTurbine.&nbsp;
Selecting
this menu item pops up a dialog in which the user can enter multiple
Sources
from which to mirror data (see dialog below).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
"Push" mirror: A mirror is established between a local Source and a new
RBO located in either the local or a remote DataTurbine.&nbsp; In <i>rbnbAdmin</i>
this can be done by selecting "Mirror to..." on a local Source's Pop-Up
menu.</li>
</ul>
A sample "Mirror Data" dialog is shown below.&nbsp; This dialog was
obtained
by selecting the "Mirror from..." Pop-Up menu item on the top level
DataTurbine
(which allows the entry of multiple "From" Sources).
<center>
<p><img src="mirrorDialog.jpg" height="558" width="446"></p>
</center>
<p>A description of the dialog items follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
"<i>To</i>" description: This defines the new RBO that will receive the
mirrored data.&nbsp; Specify the "<b>Name</b>" and "<b>Address</b>"
required
to connect to the DataTurbine and the "<b>Data Path</b>" of the new
RBO.&nbsp;
For a "Pull" mirror, the "<b>Name</b>" and "<b>Address</b>" text fields
are filled in and desensitized (non-editable) since the target
DataTurbine
in this case is always the local DataTurbine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
"<i>From</i>" description: This defines the Source(s) from which data
will
be mirrored.&nbsp; Specify the "<b>Name</b>" and "<b>Address</b>"
required
to connect to the DataTurbine and the "<b>Data Path</b>" to the
existing
Source.&nbsp; When establishing a "Push" mirror from a local Source the
"<b>Name</b>", "<b>Address</b>" and "<b>Data Path</b>" text fields are
filled in and desensitized (non-editable) since these fields are
specified
by the user's selection.&nbsp; Selecting the "Mirror from..." Pop-Up
menu
item on the top level DataTurbine yields the dialog shown above, which
allows the entry of multiple "From" Sources.&nbsp; In this case, each
Source
is specified by its "<b>Name</b>", "<b>Address</b>" and "<b>Data Path</b>"
text fields.&nbsp; Source "<b>Name</b>", "<b>Address</b>" and "<b>Data
Path</b>" fields are added and removed using the provided <b>Add</b>
and
    <b>Remove</b>
buttons.&nbsp; If there are multiple "From" Sources then multiple
mirrors
will be created with Data Paths of the form &lt;specified "To" Data
Path&gt;.&lt;index&gt;
(for example, for the dialog shown above, the Data Paths of the mirrors
created will be "newSource.1", "newSource.2", "newSource.3", etc.).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
"<i>Start</i>" time: Specify the earliest data to mirror.&nbsp; Choices
are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Now</b>: start mirroring data from this point in time,</li>
    <li>
      <b>Oldest</b>: mirror starting from the oldest available data.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
"<i>Stop</i>" time: Specify when to stop mirroring data.&nbsp; Choices
are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Now</b>: stop mirroring data at this point in time (this
option is not
currently available),</li>
    <li>
      <b>Continuous</b>: continuously mirror data (no designated stop
time).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
"<i>Buffer Size</i>": Specify the number of <b>Cache Frames, Archive
Frames,</b>
and <b>Archive Mode</b> in the new source.&nbsp; Automatically match
the
"From" Source's cache size, archive size, and archive mode by selecting
the "<b>Match Source</b>" checkbox.</li>
</ul>
Note:&nbsp; If the "To" server matches the "From" server (i.e. their
address
and name matches), the new RBO is created on the same DataTurbine as
the
existing Source.&nbsp; In this case, the "To" data path must not be the
same as the "From" data path (that is, a DataTurbine cannot have two
identically
named RBOs).
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h1><a name="Routing"></a>Routing</h1>
RBNB Servers can be routed in one of two ways:
<ul>
  <li>
Parent/Child Routing</li>
  <li>
Routing Shortcuts</li>
</ul>
The former is a hierarchical routing in which RBNB servers are
connected
via a strict topology.&nbsp; The fully qualified name of any server is
its full-path, as in:
<blockquote>/grandparent/parent/child</blockquote>
The parent of a server is specified at the time an RBNB server is
launched
(via a <i>rbnbServer</i> startup flag).&nbsp; Shortcuts can be started
at run time via <i>rbnbAdmin</i>, using the pop-up <b>Start
shortcut...</b>
option by right clicking the connected RBNB server icon (i.e.the server
to which <i>rbnbAdmin</i> has an open connection).&nbsp; The following
figure shows the shortcut pop up configuration menu.
<center>
<p><img src="shortcut.jpg" height="197" width="389"></p>
</center>
<p>Sources and channels on a routed shortcut are addressed via the<b>
Shortcut
Name</b>.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<blockquote>/MyServer/ShortcutName/remoteSource/chan1</blockquote>
The <b>Cost</b> associated with a shortcut is used to select the best
path
to fetch data when there is more than one way available (e.g. when
there
are parent/child routes and shortcut routes both available to the
target
server).
<p>To see the sources and channels in a routed RBNB server, you may
need
to click the <b>Refresh</b> option from the right-click popup menu on
that
server.
