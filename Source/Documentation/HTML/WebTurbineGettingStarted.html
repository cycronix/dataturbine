RBNB WebTurbine - Getting Started</h1>
There are a few basic steps to getting started with the RBNB WebTurbine
package:
<ol>
<li>
Install WebTurbine</li>

<li>
Launch Servlet Engine</li>

<li>
Share Data</li>

<li>
Customize Your Setup</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Install WebTurbine</h2>
Visit the RBNB Web site at <a href="http://rbnb.creare.com">http://rbnb.creare.com</a>
, and download the latest release of the RBNB V2 software.&nbsp; Run the
delivered <i>InstallAnywhere</i> package to install the software to your
computer.
<p>If you are curious, browse the delivered software files.&nbsp; You will
find two main collections of software:
<ul>
<li>
RBNB WebTurbine package</li>

<li>
"Catalina" Web server and servlet engine</li>
</ul>
You can launch and run the RBNB pieces through direct Java command line
directives.&nbsp; But it is easiest and most powerful to use the servlet
engine to do this for you, as described in the next step.
<h2>
Launch Servlet Engine</h2>
To launch the servlet engine through which your browser communicates with
the WebTurbine, click the delivered WebTurbine desktop icon (Windows) or
startup script (Unix).&nbsp; Connect to the "home page" of your local computer
using the default Catalina port 8080, as in:
<blockquote>http://localhost:8080</blockquote>
You should now see a Web page containing the default startup applications
and documentation.
<h2>
Share Data</h2>
You are now ready to put the system to work!&nbsp; First, launch a local
RBNB server using the <i>rbnbServer</i> application link from your home
page. Through this, you can send data to and from a local RBNB.&nbsp; Route
to a "Parent" RBNB on startup to extend your access to a distributed peer-to-peer
network of RBNBs.
<p>As a way to get started, publish a local directory of files using the
"Folder" PlugIn.&nbsp; On the "View RBNB Channels" page, review links to
your local RBNB channels, including the files you published.&nbsp; These
URLs are available to any Web browser (with access to your network and
computer).
<h2>
Customize Your Setup</h2>
Now you can begin use the full power of RBNB and the Web Access system.&nbsp;
Explore combinations of the delivered PlugIns.&nbsp; For example, use the
<i>Virtual Source PlugIn</i> to process vector data from <i>rbnbSource</i>
to PNG graphics images (using the <i>PNGPlugin</i>).
<p>Use the RBNB V2 API to develop your own applications and PlugIns, from
Java, 'C', or directly from packages like Matlab. WebTurbine provides a
"WebCentric" hook to the power of RBNB data distribution.
