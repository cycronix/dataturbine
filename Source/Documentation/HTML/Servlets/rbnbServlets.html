RBNB Servlet Deployment Guide</h1>
This guide outlines the process by which additional applications and PlugIns
may be added to the servlet-based web configuration and deployment system.&nbsp;
Operationally, from the displayed list of available servlets, a user clicks
to a configuration page.&nbsp; Once the configuration is complete, the
user clicks to start.&nbsp; The HTML document invokes a Javaserver Page,
which in turn invokes the appropriate Java class.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Getting Started</h3>
There are three steps to deploying a new servlet.&nbsp; First, copy the
class file into the appropriate directory.&nbsp; Second, create a HTML
document to configure and start it.&nbsp; Third, edit the HTML document
which lists and links the available servlets.
<p>You will need a Java class file for the servlet you are adding to the
system, and knowledge of the configuration parameters for it.&nbsp; Source
code for the VSourcePlugIn and VChansPlugIn is provided, but you will need
a <i>javac</i> compiler.&nbsp; A version is available at no charge from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/">Sun</a> as part of the JDK.
<p>All directories and files mentioned here are relative to the RBNB install
directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Copy Class File</h3>
Copy the servlet class file into the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>jakarta-tomcat-4.0.1\webapps\webTurbine\WEB-INF\classes</b>
<br>directory.&nbsp; This directory contains the class files for all servers,
applications, and PlugIns deployed by the system.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Create HTML Document</h3>
In the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>jakarta-tomcat-4.0.1\webapps\webTurbine</b>
<br>directory, copy <i>StartVSourcePI.html</i> and rename for your servlet.&nbsp;
Edit this file, tailoring the names and configuration options to your servlet.
<p>For most servlets, using the provided Javaserver Page, <i>StartPlugIn.jsp</i>,
is recommended.&nbsp; If there are unusually complex configuration options,
a specialized Javaserver Page may be written.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Edit List of Available Servlets</h3>
Edit the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>jakarta-tomcat-4.0.1\webapps\webTurbine\index.html</b>
<br>file, adding a link to and brief description of your servlet.
