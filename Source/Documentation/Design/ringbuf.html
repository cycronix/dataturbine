<h1>RBNB V2 Ring Buffer Structure</h1>
 
<p>This document describes the structure of the ring buffer in the V2.x RBNB 
system.<br>
 </p>
 
<h2>Overview</h2>
 One of the two main features of the RBNB - Ring Buffered Network Bus - is 
the Ring Buffer.  The Ring Buffers function as virtual data servers, managing
and archiving data from local and remote clients.
<p><b>Dynamic Ring Buffers</b> link data source sources with the balance
of the RBNB environment. Their critical "ring buffering" function enables
downstream monitors to request contiguous segments of historical or "most
recent" data for applications that require more than single-point "current
value tables". &nbsp;This is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Ring Buffers can be configured to provide a combination of RAM memory 
for high-speed gapless access to a specified amount of most-recent data (termed
the "Cache"), plus slower disk memory for playback of historical data (termed
the "Archive"). In addition, the Ring Buffers can function as the primary
long-term data storage mechanism simply by configuring an appropriately large
disk file.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Archive overlaps, rather than appends to, the Cache, providing additional
storage for Frames that are not in memory.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Ring Buffer entails additional objects, termed
"FrameSets" and "FileSets". These objects, while not directly visible to
the source application, determine the details of how the Ring Buffer is trimmed
and the structure of the Archive disk directory hierarchy. The source application
programmer often need not be concerned with these additional objects, but
an understanding of them may be helpful.<br>
</p>
<h2>The Structure of the Ring Buffer</h2>
<p>The Ring Buffer acts as a continuous ring from which old data is removed
to make way for newer data. Data is sent to the RBNB server in the form of
Frames - created when a Channel Map is flushed by the application to a simple
API Source. The Ring Buffer consists of a hierarchy of objects, as shown
in Figure 2.</p>

                                <p>The simple API allows the source application
to specify how many Frames should be stored in the Cache and Archive. However,
because the simple API does not allow the application to specify the number
of FrameSets in the Cache or FileSets in the Archive, the actual number of
Frames stored may exceed the desired value.<br>
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Structure of the Cache<br>
                                </h3>
                                <p>The Cache consists of one or more FrameSets,
each of which comprises one or more Frames. The Cache is a ring of slots
for FrameSets. When a new FrameSet is added to the Cache, it is placed into
a slot, replacing any previous FrameSet occupying that slot A FrameSet is
a list of slots for Frames. When Frame is added to the FrameSet, it may fill
up the last empty slot. At that time, the FrameSet is closed and a new FrameSet
is created. Frames are always added to the newest FrameSet.</p>
                                <p>Thus the Cache has a granularity of FrameSets,
rather than Frames. The simple API allows the source application to set the
number of Frames, but not the number of FrameSets, stored in the Cache.However,
when the Cache is full, entire FrameSets are removed. This can result in
a significant decrease in the number of Frames in the Cache whenever a FrameSet
is filled up.<br>
                                </p>
                                <p>Once a FrameSet is closed, it cannot be
reopened to add new Frames. This is true even if the FrameSet was closed
because the source application shut down the Ring Buffer.<br>
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Structure of the Archive</h3>
The Archive consists of one or more FileSets, each of which comprises one
or more FrameSets, each comprising one or more Frames. The Archive is a ring
of slots for FileSets. When a new FileSet is added to the Archive, it is
placed into a slot, replacing any previous FileSet occupying that slot. A
FileSet is a list of slots for FrameSets. When a FrameSet is added to the
FileSet, it may fill up the last empty slot. At that time, the FileSet is
closed and a new FileSet is created. FrameSets are always added to the newest
FileSet.<br>
                                <br>
Thus the Archive has a granularity of FileSets, rather than either FrameSets
or Frames. The simple API allows the source application to set the number
of Frames, not the number of FileSets or FrameSets, stored in the Archive.
However, when the Archive is full, entire FileSets are removed. This can
result in a signiciant decrease in the number of Frames in the Archive whenever
a FileSet is filled up.<br>
                                <br>
On the disk, an Archive consists of a single folder containing some files
and additional folders representing the FileSets in the Archive. Each FileSet
consists of a folder containing several files. When the FileSet is removed
from the Archive, its associated folder and the contents of that folder are
deleted.<br>
                                <br>
FrameSets are added to the FileSet when they are closed by the Cache. In
effect, they exist in both the Archive and the Cache simultaneously. FrameSets
placed into a FileSet are written to the disk. Each FileSet in the Archive
is stored as a separate folder of several different files on the disk.<br>
                                <br>
As with FrameSets, once closed, a FileSet is not reopened to add new Frames
(or FrameSets).<br>
                                <h2>Configuration of the Ring Buffer</h2>
The Ring Buffer is configured through the use of four values:<br>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>The number of Frames to be stored in
the Cache (<i>FiC</i>),</li>
                                  <li>The number of FrameSets to be stored
in the Cache (<i>FSiC</i>),</li>
                                  <li>The number of Frames to be stored in
the Archive (<i>FiA</i>), and</li>
                                  <li>The number of FileSets to be stored
in the Archive (<i>FlSiA</i>).</li>
                                </ol>
The number of Frames in the Cache and the number of Frames in the Archive
can be set by the source application via the simple API. At this time, the
number of FrameSets in the Cache and the number of FileSets in the Archive
are hardcoded to be 10.<br>
                                <br>
These four values are used to set the following values:<br>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>The number of Frames in a FrameSet,
(<i>FiFS</i>) and</li>
                                  <li>The number of FrameSets in a FileSet
(<i>FSiFlS</i>).</li>
                                </ol>
These values are calculated using the following formulas:<br>
                                <blockquote><i>FiFS</i> = ceiling(<i>FiC
                                  </i>/ <i>FSiC</i>)<br>
                                  <i>FSiFlS</i> = ceiling(<i>FiA</i> / <i>
FiFS</i>) / <i>FlSiA</i><br>
                                  </blockquote>
