To Do Notes:

Folder ~/Documents/GIT/DataTurbine is "master" source per GitHub, but the buildable-source is still under Eclipse workspace (~/Documents/OSDT_GIT).
Cluge for now is to edit/build under Eclipse and copy/commit to here (~/Documents/GIT/DataTurbine).

Running ant build *outside* Eclipse (JVM8+) has some dangling issues:
- javadoc through V3.4 would bail on errors, latest trunk code has added -Xdoclint:none to build.xml that re-enables javadoc build
- ChartServlet is not building, error on "Drawable".  This class is in jcommon.jar, but build isn't finding it now?  (To Fix)

Moving forward (if supported), fold build system into GitHub system and update ant build to run stand-alone under JVM8+.
